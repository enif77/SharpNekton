# Sharp Nekton

Sharp Nekton is a small embedable language for .NET.

A very old piece of code I just (2019-05-15) retrieved from my archives.
It is incomplete and without any documentation. I'll revive it over time...

The most interesting part here is the evaluator. It is stack based virtual machine,
that uses as-a-class implemented opcodes, without using any kind of a bytecode. 
It makes the evaluator very simple and effective.
